# Programming 4 slides

This repo contains most of the slides used in the course [Programming 4](https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/page/51/Programming+4) for the bachelor program [Digital Arts and Entertainment](https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be) at [Hogeschool West Vlaanderen](https://www.howest.be).

During the course we discuss several software design patterns, using the book [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) by Robert Nystrom as reading material. We also discuss several [C++ core guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines), using the book [Beautiful C++](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beautiful-c-30/9780137647767/) by Guy Davidson and Kate Gregory.

The slides are not organised in weeks, since the order in which we discuss the patterns can shift from year to year. Instead the slides are organised per topic.
